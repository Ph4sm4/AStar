## A* algorithm
My own visual representation of A* pathfinding algorithm - Created using Qt C++.

#### Node explanation:
- Red - The shortest path from start to end
- Yellow with S - starting node
- Yellow with E - end node
- Black - a wall/obstacle
- Light blue - nodes that have been visited by the algorithm

#### Controlls:
- Start node can be changed using left click
- Right node can be changed using right click
- Walls can be added by scroll-clicking on the node
